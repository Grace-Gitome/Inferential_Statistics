    "As we have seen in the previous article, “Inferential Statistics” plays a significant role in Data Science. Central Limit Theorem(CLT) is the most commonly used technique by Data Scientists in the real-world, a part of Inferential Statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "To know about CLT, first, we need to understand the following topics:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Sample\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Sampling Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sample\n",
    "\n",
    "The selection of some of the employees/population from the whole employees/population list is known as Sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s say we have a company in which 30,000 employees are working. We want to find out the daily commute time of all the employees. It will be very tedious and time-consuming to go to every employee and note their commute time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s see if there is another way to complete the task. Say in the company; we took a survey of 100 random employees. After the survey, we calculated the mean of the employees’ commute time at 36.6 min. Is this enough to say that all the employee’s commute time is 36.6 min by considering just 100 random employees?\n",
    "\n",
    "No, we cannot say that. The overall mean will be something of 36.6+error, i.e., if the error is 3 min, then the employees’ overall mean will be between “36.6–3” to “36.6+3”. Now, how do we find out the error?\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer that question, first, we have to understand the Sampling Terminology.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Total number of items/population, Population Size = N\n",
    "\n",
    "        Mean of the population, Population Mean(μ) = (Σ * X)/N\n",
    "\n",
    "        Variance of the population, Population Variance(σ²) = Σ( Xi — μ )²/ N\n",
    "\n",
    "        Number of items/population, Sample Size = n\n",
    "\n",
    "        Mean of the sample employees, Sample Mean(x¯) = (Σ * x)/n\n",
    "\n",
    "        Variance of the sample, Sample Variance(S²) = Σ( xi — x¯)²/ n-1\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s see how we can find the Sample Mean & Sample Variance from a given Sample Size,\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to find the average height of people in an area from the following sample data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "        Sample Size(n) = 5\n",
    "\n",
    "        Sample Mean(x¯) =(121.92+133.21+141.34+126.23+175.74)/5 =139.69\n",
    "\n",
    "        Sample Variance(S) = sqrt[{(121.92–139.69)²+(133.21–139.69)²+(141.34–139.69)²+(126.23–139.69)²+(175.74–139.69)²}/4] = 21.45.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is how we calculate the Sample Mean and Variance with the help of sample data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Sampling Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "    Sampling Distribution is a probability of distribution obtained from many samples drawn from a population list.\n",
    "\n",
    "    What it means is, we have 30000 employees in our company. First, we select 50 random employees and calculate their mean, let it be x¯1. After that, we’ll take another 50 random employees from the whole list and calculate the mean, which is x¯2. Let’s say we continued this process and calculated the mean up to x¯100.\n",
    "\n",
    "    So what we have, interestingly enough, is the distribution for sample means.\n",
    "\n",
    "    If we plot all the sample means distribution in a graph, it represents Binomial Distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Sampling Distribution has some fascinating properties, which ultimately helps in finding the error in population mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The sampling distribution’s mean is denoted by μₓ¯.\n",
    "\n",
    "    μₓ¯ = (Sum of all the sample means)/(Total number of samples)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two important properties of a sample distribution mean:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Sampling Distribution Mean(μₓ¯) = Population Mean(μ)\n",
    "\n",
    "    Sampling distribution’s standard deviation (Standard error) = σ/√n, where σ is the population’s standard deviation and n is the sample size."
